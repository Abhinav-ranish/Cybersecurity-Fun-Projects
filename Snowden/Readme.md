## Edward Snowden vs. Other Hackers

1. **Snowden's Role as a Government Insider**:
   - Snowden worked inside the NSA, giving him access to classified info. Unlike hackers like Robert Morris, who were outsiders, Snowden had the system’s trust before choosing to expose its flaws.

2. **Moral Angle of Snowden's Actions**:
   - Snowden didn’t hack for fun or fame; he did it because he believed the government was violating people’s privacy. It’s different from other hackers, who often act out of curiosity or rebellion, not with the intention of sparking an ethical debate.

3. **Robert Morris vs. Snowden**:
   - Robert Morris created the first internet worm in 1988, but it was a mistake. He didn’t plan on the damage it caused. Snowden, on the other hand, was deliberate. He knew the consequences and still made the choice to leak sensitive information to protect citizens' rights.

4. **Not Just a Hacker in a Suit**:
   - Snowden wasn’t your typical hacker. He wasn’t in it for fame or power. He took the risk of exposing government secrets because he felt it was the right thing to do, even if it meant risking everything.

5. **Responsibility in Exposing Secrets**:
   - In *Citizenfour*, Snowden carefully selected journalists and made sure the leak was handled responsibly. It wasn’t some chaotic move like other hackers’ work, which can sometimes have no clear goal or outcome.

6. **The Personal Sacrifice**:
   - Snowden didn’t just leak documents; he gave up his entire life. He fled the country, leaving his career and freedom behind. That’s a level of sacrifice most hackers don’t face. His actions were driven by a deep belief in transparency, not just breaking the system.

7. **Impact on Public Discourse**:
   - Snowden changed the conversation about privacy and government surveillance. While other hackers might focus on disruption, Snowden’s leak sparked global debates on civil liberties, setting him apart from many in the hacking world.
