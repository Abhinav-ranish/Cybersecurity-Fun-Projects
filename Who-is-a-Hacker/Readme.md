# 🧠 Hacker Portfolio – Cybersecurity Fun Projects

> *"What does it mean to be a hacker?"*
> After 15 weeks of hands-on work, experimentation, and critical thinking, I now define it as:
> **A hacker is someone who reclaims control — over systems, code, and limitations.**

This is a collection of creative cybersecurity projects developed during a class journey rooted in ethical hacking, system manipulation, and digital rebellion.

## 🧠 Reflection

> “To be a hacker is to be free.”

This class helped me see hacking as more than breaking systems—it's about questioning them, rebuilding them, and sometimes reclaiming what’s rightfully yours.
Rooting my ISP’s TV box with Dirty COW wasn’t just technical—it was personal.
